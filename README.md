Breadboard
==========

Electronics Breadboard Simulator (sort-of).

What is it?
-----------

Breadboard is sort of an "electronics toy" of sorts. You can place wires, transistors and stuff onto a grid and see what happens.

This is by no means any sort of way to design circuits, I just made this for fun.

How to use it?
--------------

Simply click on a component from the toolbar on the left and click anywhere on the grid to place it. Some components have other functions, for example transistors can be switched between nmos and pmos. To switch between functions simply click on the component again.

What to do with it?
-------------------

Have fun!

N.B. The current version cannot save. Still working on it :P
