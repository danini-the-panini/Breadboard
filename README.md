Breadboard
==========

Electronics Breadboard Simulator (sort-of).

What is it?
-----------

Breadboard is sort of an "electronics toy" of sorts. You can place wires, transistors and stuff onto a grid and see what happens.

This is by no means any sort of way to design actual electronic components, I just made this for fun.

How to use it?
--------------

Should be pretty simple. To add components, click on the edit button (the one that looks like a pencil) and select the component to draw with. Some components can be changed by clicking on them with the cursor tool. This includes switching on/off sources, changing lamp colour, alternating between nmos and pmos transistors, and rotating diodes.

What to do with it?
-------------------

Have fun!

Future features?
----------------

Oscilators with varying clock speeds.
7-segment displays.
Custom components.
